## Recommendations

### 1. Create Missing Views
The following views need to be created in `resources/views/admin/repair-service/`:
```
admin/repair-service/
├── dashboard.blade.php
├── service-categories/
│   ├── index.blade.php
│   └── create.blade.php
├── services/
│   ├── index.blade.php
│   └── create.blade.php
├── components/
│   ├── index.blade.php
│   └── create.blade.php
└── reports.blade.php
```

### 2. Fix View References
Update the RepairServiceController to use correct view names:
- `admin.repair-service.service-categories` → `admin.repair-service.service-categories.index`
- `admin.repair-service.services` → `admin.repair-service.services.index`
- `admin.repair-service.components` → `admin.repair-service.components.index`

### 3. Test POST Routes
The following POST routes need testing with proper CSRF tokens:
- `/admin/settings/*` (various settings updates)
- `/admin/repair-service/technicians/{id}/approve`
- `/admin/repair-service/technicians/{id}/status`
- `/admin/repair-service/bookings/{id}/assign-technician`
- `/admin/repair-service/bookings/{id}/status`
